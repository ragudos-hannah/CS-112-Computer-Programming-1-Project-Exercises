# CS-112-Computer-Programming-1-Project-Exercises
This repository contains projects from CS 112: Computer Programming 1, completed during my first semester at Saint Louis University. Spanning from foundational Java programming and algorithm design to practical implementation of data structures and algorithms, these projects exemplify my developing skills and application of programming principles.
