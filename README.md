# CS 112 Computer Programming 1 - Projects Exercises Repository

## Description

Welcome to my repository, encapsulating my educational and developmental journey through CS 112 - Computer Programming 1, during my first semester at **Saint Louis University**. This repository mirrors my developmental trajectory, illustrating the evolution from grasping basic programming principles to applying them in practical projects.

## Contents & Learning Journey

   - **Key Learnings**: Fundamental concepts of programming languages, environments, and processes.
   - **Project Insight**: Initial coding endeavors illustrating basic algorithmic structures, syntax, and semantics.
   - **Resources**: [Oracle's Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/index.html)

#### 2. **Java Essentials**
   - **Key Learnings**: Dive into Java programming, including its components, naming conventions, and type conversions.
   - **Project Insight**: Simple Java programs showcasing the usage of various data types and components.
   - **Resources**: [Java Basic Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html)

#### 3. **Control Flow in Java**
   - **Key Learnings**: Mastery over sequential, conditional, and iterative constructs in Java.
   - **Project Insight**: Implementing diverse control flow scenarios via Java programming.
   - **Resources**: [Essential Java Classes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/index.html)

### Midterm Period
#### 4. **Program Decomposition**
   - **Key Learnings**: Understanding and applying program decomposition and modular programming.
   - **Project Insight**: Building programs utilizing method declarations, headers, and modifiers.
   - **Resources**: Referenced Chapter 4, "Introduction to Programming Using Java".

### Finals Period
#### 5. **Array Manipulations and Algorithms**
   - **Key Learnings**: Array data management, parameter passing, and implementing sorting and searching algorithms.
   - **Project Insight**: 
      - Data handling and manipulation using single and multi-dimensional arrays.
      - Implementing sorting (Bubble, Balloon, Insertion Sort) and search algorithms (Linear, Binary).
   - **Resources**: Engaged with Chapter 7, "Introduction to Programming Using Java".

## Methodologies

- Engaged in **Online Discussions** and **Demonstrations** for theoretical knowledge acquisition.
- Hands-on learning through **Problem Solving** and **Programming Exercises**.
- **Assessments** via various programming activities and a final project to gauge and demonstrate skill development.
