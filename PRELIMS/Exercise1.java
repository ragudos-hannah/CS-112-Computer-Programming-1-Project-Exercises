//Objectives
//1. Create a Java source code/program using the prescribed Integrated Development Environment [Intellij
//IDEA]
//2. Compile a Java source program into Bytecode
//3. Run a compiled Java program
//4. Describe the structure of a Java Program with a main method (Executable program)
//5. Apply the output statement System.out.println()
//6. Explain why the Java programming language is case-sensitive
//[i.e. The keywords import, public, class, static, and void are in lower cases (small letters). The identifiers
//String and System begin with capital letters. The identifiers main and args are in lowercase]
